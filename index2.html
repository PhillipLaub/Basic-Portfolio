                            name is Phil Laub. I grew up right here in Southern California, and spent most of my life in
                            between Hemet and San Diego. I have a Wife and a five year old daughter, who I spend every
                            waking moment with that I am able. I grew up as a musician, which led me to have such a love
                            for different kinds of music. From Classic Rock to Hip Hop, just please don't subject me to
                            listening to any country music. Some of my favorites include: <em>The Gorillaz, Wu-Tang, The
                                Offspring, Eminem, Green Day, Led Zeppelin</em>, and many more.
                            <br>
                            I am also an enormous nerd, I love the Marvel franchise, however, I am much more of a DC
                            fan (hopefully they can stop making such a mess of their movies one of these days). I am a
                            big gamer, grew up with era of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>,
                            nowadays I mostly
                            play first person shooters with my friends whenever I get the chance. I spent more than a
                            decade managing electronic stores, and I am extremely enthusiastic to be stepping forward
                            into a career that is challenging and also provides the opportunity to create. I want to use
                            what I learn to solve problems, make life easier and more convenient, and create something
                            that can bring some joy into someones life.
