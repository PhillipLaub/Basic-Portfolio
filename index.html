    The content for the index.html should be unique to you.



Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name isâ€”that is fine and expected.
Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page.
